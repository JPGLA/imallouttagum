                    Assassin's Creed Mirage | October 5
                    Seems Ubisoft's grown nostalgic for the age when Assassin's Creed had a few more assassins (and creeds thereof). In Mirage, become the most lethal man in Baghdad as the series returns to form.

                <p>
                    It hasn't been long since Cities: Skylines set the current standard for city builders, but it never hurts to cement your place on the throne. The sequel touts new levels of city simulation, promising unprecedented creativity in urban planningâ€”at least until you have to figure out traffic, anyway.

        <h3>Alan Wake 2 | October 27</h3>
        <p>
            After cementing their own combined cinematic universe in Control, Remedy is revisiting their wretched little man as they make their survival horror debut. Yeah, Alan's been trapped in a pocket dimension of psychological torment for ten years, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
